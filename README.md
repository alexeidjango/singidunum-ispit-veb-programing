This project is made for demonstration purposes only. It consists of a very simple server based on Flask, and a frontend part.

Since the server part is made exclusively with the aim of providing demonstration of AJAX requests, navigation and use of templates, there are no server-side validations at all (which is of course not acceptable on a real-life project). 

Neither part of it should ever be used in production code, nor should be used as an example of a good code (because it is not).
